It organizes code into objects that interact with each other. It focuses on concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.\n","\n","2) What is a class in OOP?\n"," - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the created objects will have. A class defines how the objects will behave and interact.\n","\n","3) What is an object in OOP?\n"," - An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you are instantiating a class, which means creating an actual entity with the properties and methods defined in the class.\n","\n","4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n"," - Abstraction hides the implementation details and shows only the functionality. It is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n"," - Encapsulation involves bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within one unit (class). It also hides the internal state by restricting access via access modifiers (public, private).\n","\n","5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n"," - Dunder Methods in Python: Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that have a special meaning, such as __init__ (constructor), __str__ (string representation), __repr__, and others like __add__ for operator overloading.\n","\n","6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n"," - Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the attributes and methods from another class (parent class). It promotes code reuse.\n","\n","7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n"," - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single method to behave differently depending on the object it is acting on.\n","\n","8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n"," - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by defining methods and variables within a class, and restricting access to the internal state using private (__var) and protected (_var) members, while providing public methods to interact with them.\n","\n","9) What is a constructor in Python?\n"," - A constructor is a special method __init__() in Python, called when a new object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n","\n","10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n"," - Class method: Defined using @classmethod, it is bound to the class and can modify class variables.\n"," - Static method: Defined using @staticmethod, it doesn't take any special first argument (self or cls) and doesn’t access or modify class or instance variables.\n","\n","11) What is method overloading in Python?\n"," - python does not support traditional method overloading (same method name with different parameters). However, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs).\n","\n","12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n"," - Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n","\n","13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n"," - The property decorator is used to define a method as a property. It allows the method to be accessed like an attribute while controlling how it is accessed or modified.\n","\n","14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n"," - Polymorphism allows flexibility and reusability of code. It helps in designing systems that can work with objects of different classes, as long as they share a common interface or base class.\n","\n","15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n"," - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It defines abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass. It is defined using the abc module in Python.\n","\n","16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n"," - Advantages of OOP:\n","  Reusability through inheritance.\n","  Modularity through classes and objects.\n","  Maintainability and easier debugging.\n","  Scalability for large applications.\n","\n","17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n"," - Class variable is shared by all instances of the class.\n"," - Instance variable is unique to each instance of the class.\n","\n","18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n"," - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. Python supports multiple inheritance, which means a class can have more than one superclass.\n","\n","19) Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n"," - __str__: Provides a human-readable string representation of an object (for print() and str()).\n"," - __repr__: Provides a detailed and unambiguous string representation of an object (used by the repr() function).\n","\n","20) What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n"," -  super() is used to call methods from the parent class. It is commonly used in the constructor (__init__) to ensure that the parent class is initialized properly.\n","\n","21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n"," - The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup purposes, like closing files or releasing resources.\n","\n","22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n"," - @staticmethod: Doesn't access or modify class or instance variables; behaves like a regular function.\n"," - @classmethod: Takes the class (cls) as the first argument, and can modify class variables.\n","\n","23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n"," - Polymorphism in Python is achieved through inheritance by defining methods in the parent class that are overridden in child classes. It allows different classes to have methods with the same name but different behaviors.\n","\n","24) What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n"," - Method chaining refers to calling multiple methods in a single line, where each method returns the object itself (i.e., return self), allowing further method calls.\n","\n","25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n"," - The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. It can make the object behave like a function, adding more flexibility to how objects are used.\n","\n"," #PRACTICAL QUESTIONS\n","\n"," 1.
